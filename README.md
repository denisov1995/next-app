Project Setup

Prerequisites
Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

Node.js (v14 or higher recommended)

npm (usually comes with Node.js)

Prisma CLI (will be installed as a dependency)

Installation Steps
Install Dependencies

Navigate to the project's root directory and run the following command to install all the necessary dependencies:

bash
Copy
npm install
This will install all the packages listed in the package.json file.

Generate Prisma Client

After installing the dependencies, you need to generate the Prisma Client. Run the following command:

bash
Copy
npx prisma generate
This command reads your Prisma schema and generates the Prisma Client, which is used to interact with your database.

Set Up Environment Variables

The project requires certain environment variables to be set for proper functioning. These variables typically include database connection strings, API keys, and other sensitive information.

Create a .env file in the root directory of the project.

Copy the contents from .env.example (if available) into the newly created .env file.

Fill in the required values for each environment variable.

Example .env file:

env
Copy
DATABASE_URL="your_database_connection_string"
API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
Make sure not to commit the .env file to version control (e.g., Git) as it may contain sensitive information.

Run the Project

Once all the above steps are completed, you can start the project. Depending on the project, you might use one of the following commands:

bash
Copy
npm start
or

bash
Copy
npm run dev
This will start the application, and you should be able to access it via the specified port (usually http://localhost:3000).

Additional Notes
If you encounter any issues during the setup, please refer to the project's documentation or reach out to the maintainers.

Make sure your database is running and accessible if the project requires it.

Thank you for setting up the project! If you have any questions or run into any issues, feel free to open an issue or contact the project maintainers.
